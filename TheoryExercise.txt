1-d
2-a
3-c
4-b

While doing the practical exercices and after a bit of research, we understood that:

- When the sign of k(s) changes, the curve starts rotating in the opposite direction
- k(s) tends to infinity <=> the curve will make smaller and smaller circles (clockwise
  or counter-clockwise depending if k tends to infinity or minus infinity).

This is quite intuitive, since k(s) determines the curvature of the curve, i.e. the rate
of curving/bending at position s. So the higher k gets, the more curved c gets.

We solved the exercise only by using the two above facts:

- k1 is the only function that doesn't tend to infinity; d is the only curve whose 
  circles don't get smaller and smaller => 1-d

- a's curve changes direction only once; k3 and k4's sign change more than once, 
  k2's sign changes only once => 2-a

- k4 keeps changing sign over and over because of the sin, which is not the case for k3
  => 4-b

- By elimination, 3-c
