Construct our methods step by step
    - cut the mesh arbitrarly in the middle
    - make kind of "goutte" falling from the bottom of the mesh (add points under the mesh randomly and link them to the bottom of the mesh)
    - make the water fall on the top of the mesh
    - smooth to make it water-like (until there it can be just lines (not smooth at all))

Create one method for each of those things with parameters

BONES MESHE

- simulate holes on visage (in function of x,y,z, seed) for eyes, nose, mouth, etc..
- get a bones mesh to be make 2nd part of the head
- smoothing/enhancement

INTRO: TODO
clearly explain what we want to do, add picture


STEP 1: Holes
Punch some holes in the meshes to let the light through:
	- skull: eyes, nose and space between the jaws (teeth)
	- face: eyes and nostrils
	- TODO: how to do this? We could implement a method such that when we click a vertex it disappears (could be hard) or do it in a software
	
STEP 2: cutting
Vertically cut the skull and the face in two halves. Keep only the left half of the face and the right half of the skull (or vice-versa)
	- technically the idea is to delete every vertex v such that the x-coordinate of v is smaller/bigger than 0 (supposing that the origin is at the center of the mesh)

STEP 3: merge ("glue") the half-face and the half-skull together
We'll need to create triangles that will join the edge-vertices of the half-skull and the edge vertices of the half-face. We'll have to design an algorithm that decides which vertices
of the face should be linked to which vertices of the skull (first guess would be shortest distance).
The tricky part here is that we have to make the transition between the skin and the skull look natural. Here are some steps that could help:
	- rescale the half-skull so that its circumference is the closest possible to the one of the half-face
	- eventually reshape the half-face or the half-skull in parts where the transition is not natural
	- use smoothing methods (possible to do located smoothing only on the transition vertices)
	

BONUS STEP IF THERE IS NOT ENOUGH WORK:
instead of just a vertical boudary between the face part and the skull part, we could have a diagonal or random cutting
