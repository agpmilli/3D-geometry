Construct our methods step by step
    - cut the mesh arbitrarly in the middle
    - make kind of "goutte" falling from the bottom of the mesh (add points under the mesh randomly and link them to the bottom of the mesh)
    - make the water fall on the top of the mesh
    - smooth to make it water-like (until there it can be just lines (not smooth at all))

Create one method for each of those things with parameters
