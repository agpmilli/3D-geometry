On Meshlab :
    Cleaning :
        - Remove zero area faces
        - Remove duplicate faces
        - Remove duplicated vertex
        - Remove faces from non manifold edges
        - Remove unreferenced vertex
    
    Reducing :
        - Quadric Edge Collapse Decimation (target number of faces : 50000
                                            quality threshold : 1.0
                                            preserve boundary of the mesh
                                            boundary preserving weight 1
                                            preserve normal
                                            preserve topology
                                            optimal position of simplified vertices
                                            post-simplification cleaning)
    Re-Clean (same as before)

    Haircut :
        - cut the hair
        - fill the hole using the function in meshlab
        - reclean
    
On 3DBuilder :
    - Turn it so that it is opened in the good direction in our code after
