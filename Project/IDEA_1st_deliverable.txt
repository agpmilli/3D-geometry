Programms we will use :
    -   meshlab
    -   123d make
    -   netfabb (to repair the mesh)
    
    
Functions we will implement :
    -   We would like to create holes in our mesh to make the light.
    -   
    
    
Things to take care of :
    -   thickness of the mesh
    -   base size for the lamp
    
    
    
    
GOAL :
    meshmixer : edit - make pattern 
    
    
Clean mesh :
- meshlab :
        - remove duplicate faces (0)
        - remove duplicate vertices (18)
        - remove zero area faces (0)
        - remove unreferenced vertices (3)

- netfabb :
        - default repair of the mesh (concerns :  
        Zero Holes: model will be manifold, without any gaps between faces and edges
        Zero Border Edges: a border edge is an edge on the side of a hole, or the edge side of a plane if another edge is it's missing
        Zero Invalid Orientations: In Netfabb, the direction of a face is shown in green if it points outward, red if it points inward. If you have red faces pointing out, that will be invalid orientation because it is inconsistent.
        Positive Volume: All the green faces face out and the red face in, otherwise the printer will think that everything outside the model is material causing printer issues.
        Closed Surfaces: A closed surface means that there are no holes or border edges.
        Orientable Surface:All faces must be defined as in or out, with no stray edges or vertices.)
