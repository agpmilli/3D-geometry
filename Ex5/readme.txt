EXERCISE 5.1
For curves we saw that under curvature flow any curve goes to a convex shape and then
converges to a point.
Do you experience an analogous behavior for surfaces? Experiment with various meshes,
time steps, and number of iterations. Briefly comment on your observations (no formal
proof expected).

EXERCISE 5.2
Iterate your method on the three provided cylinders. One of them shows a behavior that
is different from the other two. Can you explain what is happening? Is the result consistent
with the goal of the minimal surface optimization?
